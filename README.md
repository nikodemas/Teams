# Teams

Java application to create, read, update and delete data in MySQL table. Initially created to store information about sports teams.
Before launching the application you need to start running MySQL server on port 3306 and have a database named "teams" in there with a table also named "teams".
Table should contain 5 columns - id (auto increment), name, city, players, games. I used xampp for the MySQL server.

In order to start application after setting up the server, you just need to launch executable TeamsApplication.jar file located in \TeamsApplication\dist .
Log in username is "admin" and password is "password".
